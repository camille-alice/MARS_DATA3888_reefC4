# Aim and Background 

**A clear description of the problem, articulating the aim of this project. Provides appropriate multidisciplinary context and motivational background explained well in an appropriate language.**

# Method

**Part A: Clear description of the approach in data collection, developed model, the evaluation strategies from a data-science perspective. Here we refer to all types of evaluation metrics including graphical, qualitative and quantitative metric.**

The reef data containing the bleaching, diversity, sea-surface-temperature anomaly (SSTA), and depth metrics comes from a public dataset taken from the paper ["A global analysis of coral bleaching over the past twodecades"](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-09238-2) by Sully et al. (2019). The paper contains coral bleaching events at 3351 sites in 81 countries from 1998 to 2017. The raw data can be found at the [Reef Check website](https://www.reefcheck.org/) or on the [GitHub repository for the Institute for Global Ecology](https://github.com/InstituteForGlobalEcology/Coral-bleaching-a-global-analysis-of-the-past-two-decades).

We also used data gathered from [Allen Coral Atlas](https://allencoralatlas.org/atlas/) to build our rugosity dataset. Full extraction method can be found [here](https://github.com/camille-alice/MARS_DATA3888_reefC4/blob/main/camille_ida.Rmd). The full dataset was downloaded locally to be processed as the zipped archive was over 13GB. The files extracted contained the Geomorphic Map data that was in the shape files geomorphic.gpkg or .geojson. From investigation of the data sets on the map, it looked like the reef dataset is not as precise as the Allen Coral dataset - hence points not touching some polygons. As such, we decided to keep only the points from the Reef dataset that fell within the polygons of Allen Coral Atlas to limit uncertainty. 

**Part B: Reef project - Clear description of the approach in data collection to address appropriate research questions, developed model, the evaluation strategies from a marine science perspective**

# Results 

**Part A: A clear justification of the final approach based on the proposed evaluation strategies. Ensuring multiple evaluation strategies are used.**

**Part B: A clear description of the deployment process. An engaging and clear illustration of the product (games, shiny app, learning device etc) with a discussion of concepts from multiple disciplines.**

# Discusssion

**Discussion of potential shortcomings or issues associated with the development process or the product with reference to both disciplines. Identification of future work or improvement in both disciplines. Conclusion adequately summarises the project and identification of future work.**
